\section*{\centering{ABSTRACT}}

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has chosen the face as the primary biometric trait for machine-readable travel documents, like passports. In this context, the \icao standard defines a set of photographic requirements to ensure image quality and simplify the face recognition process. However, the assessment of face image compliance to the ISO/ICAO standard is still mostly performed by humans today due to the lack of automatic evaluation systems to perform this task. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based method, called \methodname, designed for automatic evaluation of the photographic requirements of the \icao standard. Our network employs a multi-and-collaborative learning approach, where both supervised and unsupervised learning is performed concurrently and in a collaborative manner. Experimental evidence presented in this paper has shown that our method achieves the best results in 9 out of 23 face-and-pose requirements of the \icao standard. Therefore, the proposed method can be considered the best overall solution among academic works published in the literature and private SDKs. In terms of Equal Error Rate (EER), the \methodname achieved the second-best median EER (3.3\%). Regarding performance, the TensorFlow C++ implementation of the method takes only 1.8 seconds to run on the CPU, being the fastest method to evaluate all 23 requirements according to the official benchmark.
