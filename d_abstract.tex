\section*{\centering{ABSTRACT}}

The face is considered the primary biometric trait for machine-readable travel documents, like passports. In this context, the \icao standard defines a set of photographic requirements to ensure image quality and simplify the face recognition process. However, the assessment of face image compliance to the ISO/ICAO standard is still predominantly performed by humans today due to the lack of automatic evaluation systems to perform this task. In this work, we present a deep multitask learning-based method, called \methodname, designed for automatic evaluation of the photographic requirements of the \icao standard. Our network employs a multi-and-collaborative learning approach, where both supervised and unsupervised learning is performed concurrently and in a collaborative manner. Experimental evidence presented in this paper shows that our method achieves the best results in 9 out of 23 face-and-pose requirements of the \icao, which was not achieved by any other individual method evaluated. Therefore, the proposed method can be considered the best overall solution among academic works published in the literature and private SDKs. In terms of Equal Error Rate (EER), the \methodname achieved the second-best median EER (3.3\%). Finally, the TensorFlow C++ implementation of the method takes only 1.8 seconds to run on the CPU, being the fastest method to evaluate all 23 requirements according to the official benchmark.
